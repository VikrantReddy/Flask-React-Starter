# Flask React start template
### Dont waste time on config when you have an idea that you want to implement, use this plug and play flask-react template to get started

P.S The template was meant to be used for an ecommerce site, hence one of the folders had been named mod_ecomm, you can change the names wherever's needed.
P.P.S The template only be used after the react site has been built, and the static files are openly exposed as of now.

## TODO
Can Implement an auth system to not expose the static files openly
